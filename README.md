# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Robert Mulleneaux**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I didn't use any outside resources for the project but I did read the instructions intently to make sure that I undertood what to do.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Some of the JavaScript code was challenging like the add and remove to the start and stop tone. I played the start and stop button about a million times before I realized that
it was a simple change in the add and remove switch to the stop tone. I realized that I had kept them the same to the start tone and couldn't figure out how to change them. I remember
when I was taking scripting and programming through WGU that there was a section that told us that if you keep functions the same it won't change the outcome so by pressing the button it wouldn't click 
back to start from going into stop. From remembering that lesson and implementing what the code said-after I remembered to read it over-I solved the issue and was able to move on with the project. 
Another example was when I completed the tone section and was getting ready to call it a day for my job, I went back over and reopened the glitch page to see if it still worked tone wise. It ended up not working and I started to 
get confused because the code was written and there where no issues. Again, I rechecked the code and couldn't find what was wrong. I started to think over what I could do and finally it hit me. What if I refresh the game. I did that and the tones started to work again. 
I was so relieved and happy that I went on to the next subject even though it was late.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[What projects take the longest amount of time to perfect and how can I learn the code functions easier? There are so many arguments, variables, and functions to learn it seems that it is
getting harder to learn. How would working as a team be implemented throughout the project and what kind of code would I write as a beginner in web development? How would I change the code to implement and make the game more challenging?
Would I need more learning experience to create better algorithms in the future for my Jobs]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would add all the functions necessary for the optional part of the project. Being a full time employee this has become an extremely rare chance to be 
called back for a chance to even get offered a project to do. It has been fun and enjoyable and I am glad that you guys gave me that chance. 
I wish I had more time and if given this job I will implememnt the time well learn and move forward into the learning aspect of the job to create amazing webpages and 
never give up. It will be hard and extrenuous to go the extra mile but Im ready for the run.]
